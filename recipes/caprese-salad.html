        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><strong>A great Caprese salad starts with great ingredients.</strong> This recipe is meant for summertime, when tomatoes
             are at their juiciest, sweetest, and most flavorful. I like stop by the farmers market and collect as 
             many colorful heirloom tomatoes as I can. Not only are they beautiful, but each type tastes a little 
             bit different, and it’s fun to showcase them in this simple salad. Look for greens, yellows, and reds, 
             and try to find a variety of shapes – cherry tomatoes are fair game here too!</p>
