        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This chocolate mug cake recipe has <em>no eggs</em> and can be made for one or two (if you like to share). 
            It is one of the <strong>easiest</strong> dessert recipes you’ll ever make and you’ll never make another mug cake 
            again after you try my recipe!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>2 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon baking powder</li>
                <li>2 tablespoon granulated sugar, (you can add 1 tbsp. more if you like it a bit sweeter)</li>
                <li>⅛ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
                <li>¼ cup + 1 tbsp. milk></li>
                <li>2 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon hazelnut chocolate spread or mini chocolate chips</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together dry ingredients.</li>
                <li>Whisk in the milk and vegetable oil until all ingredients are combined and batter has no clumps.</li>
                <li>Pour batter into a microwave-safe mug. Mine was a 14-ounce mug. You want enough head space for the cake to 
                    rise without pouring over.</li>
                <li>Add hazelnut chocolate spread in the middle of the batter or mini chocolate chips. Just drop it in the middle
                    , no need to push it down and sink it in the batter. It does that on its own when it cooks! :)</li>
                <li>Place a paper towel into the microwave and set the mug on top (this is to catch any batter if your mug cake overflows).</li>
                <li>Microwave mug cake for 70 seconds on high <strong>(PLEASE READ NOTES CAREFULLY BELOW)</strong></li>
                <li>Carefully remove from microwave and enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
