        <img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2r0kdewr/production/2e650a0fe9aeb76c7a0176eb09e61ac75d8ace9a-1000x563.jpg?w=600&fm=webp&q=50">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The word "congee" was derived from from the Tamil language of Ancient India, "kanji". In Cantonese, we call it "jÅ«k" (which kinda sounds like "jook"),
             but there are many, many different variations and names for it across Asia.</p>
        <p>Even though congee is commonly known as a rice porridge, it wasn't always the case. With thousands of years of history in China, congee was made with
             whatever grains were available locally: millet, cornmeal, barley, and etc.</p>
        <p>Historical accounts show that congee was enjoyed across all walks of life, from emperors to everyday people.</p>
